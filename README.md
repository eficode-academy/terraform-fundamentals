# Terraform Fundamentals Katas

Welcome to the Terraform Fundamentals Katas! This repository is designed to help new users master Terraform through practical exercises hosted on the Azure cloud. Each kata focuses on essential concepts and skills, providing a hands-on approach to learning infrastructure as code with Terraform.

Whether you're starting from scratch or looking to deepen your understanding, these challenges will guide you through creating, modifying, and managing Azure resources effectively. Dive in and start your journey to becoming proficient with Terraform!

## About Terraform

Terraform serves as an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool designed to automate the provisioning and management of cloud resources. Users define their desired infrastructure configuration using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), allowing for the creation, modification, and scaling of resources across various cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Its core functionalities include:

- **Declarative Syntax**: Define the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform will make it happen.
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components called modules help in managing complex systems with simplicity.
- **Execution Plan**: Terraform calculates and shows the actions needed to achieve the desired state before making any changes.

Terraform enhances collaboration, ensures infrastructure consistency, and supports a version-controlled, collaborative approach to managing cloud environments.

# DO_NOT_REMOVE below content


## Structure:

### Infrastructure as Code
- Introduction to IAC and Terraform
- Tool landscape (pulumi/crossplane etc)
- Intro to hahsicorp
- Terraform

### Installation
- Install/Check Terraform CLI and Azure CLI

### Launch your First VM with Terraform

Premade HCL configuration creating an app-service with an application.
This exercise should have `init`, `plan` and `apply` as well. They should not look into the code itself.

* See the URL as output of the terraform command
* Look at the website through a browser
* Use AZ cli to list the app-service as well to see that it is created (OR the UI of Azure if we can do it).
* Maybe: Apply again, to see that nothing is changing?

### Terraform Basic Commands
- `terraform init`
- `terraform plan`
- `terraform apply`
- `terraform destroy`

### Terraform Destroy
- **Lab:** Destroy the app-service created

### Basic intro to HCL language
- Overview (why create another language)
- Basic types/usages

### Providers & Resources
- Understanding Statefiles
  - Current state vs Desired
  - Remote state
  - Remote backend
- `terraform refresh`

**Lab:** Setup remote backend
* Write HCL to create the backend where they can store their state file.
* Resource block
* Add a remote backend block to store the state file.
* Optionally use AZ cli to see the state file in the state (or UI)
* If possible: make a manual change (CLI/UI) and execute `terraform refresh` to see that the state and current config has diverged.
