## About Terraform

Terraform serves as an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool designed to automate the provisioning and management of cloud resources. Users define their desired infrastructure configuration using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), allowing for the creation, modification, and scaling of resources across various cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Its core functionalities include:

- **Declarative Syntax**: Define the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform will make it happen.
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components called modules help in managing complex systems with simplicity.
- **Execution Plan**: Terraform calculates and shows the actions needed to achieve the desired state before making any changes.

Terraform enhances collaboration, ensures infrastructure consistency, and supports a version-controlled, collaborative approach to managing cloud environments.

## Pre-requisites
- Terraform CLI and Azure CLI installed on your machine
- Access to a cloud provider account with permissions to create and manage resources
- Basic knowledge of command line interfaces and text editors
