# Terraform Basic commands

## Learning Goals
- Execute the basic Terraform commands: `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`, and observe how they function in managing infrastructure.

## Introduction
This exercise provides an introduction to the basics commands of Terraform through the setup and deployment of a Flask application. Students will get to directly apply the basic Terraform commands, observe the changes each command makes, and understand their roles in the workflow of infrastructure as code.

## Pre-requisites
- Terraform installed on your  machine.
- Access to a cloud provider account with permissions to create and manage resources.
- Basic knowledge of command line interfaces and text editors.


### Flask Application
The application consists of three components, frontend, backend and a database.

The frontend and backend are small python flask webservers that listen for HTTP requests. For persistent storage, a postgresql database is used.

The base functionality of the application can be achieved by the frontend alone. The frontend listens for HTTP requests on port 5000 (the default for flask)

### Terraform Configuration
The Terraform configuration in the `terraform basic commands` directory is set to define and provision the necessary cloud infrastructure to run the Flask application, which typically includes server setup, networking, and security settings.
We will be deploying only the frontend of the flask app.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Initialize Your Terraform Workspace
Navigate to the `terraform` directory within your project

Initialize the Terraform workspace to prepare your environment:

`terraform init`


The output should resemble the example shown below.

```
```

This command sets up Terraform, installing any required provider plugins and setting up the backend for state management.

### 2. Plan Your Deployment

Generate an execution plan to preview the actions Terraform will take based on the configurations

`terraform plan`

The output should resemble the example shown below.

```
```

This plan details which resources Terraform will create, modify, or destroy, allowing you to review before making any changes to the actual infrastructure.

### 3. Apply Your Configuration

Execute the plan to create the infrastructure:


`terraform apply`


The output should resemble the example shown below.

```
```

You will be prompted to approve the action. Once confirmed, Terraform will apply the specified configurations, provisioning the necessary resources for the Flask application.


### 4. Visit the application in the browser.

You should see something like this:


## Cleanup.

Execute the following command to remove all resources and clean up the infrastructure:

`terraform destroy`

This command will prompt you to review and confirm the destruction of the resources defined in your Terraform configuration. Once confirmed, Terraform will proceed to safely remove all the resources, effectively cleaning up the deployed infrastructure. This step helps prevent unnecessary costs and ensures that the environment is reset for future exercises.


**Congratulations!** **ðŸŽ‰** You have successfully deployed a web app on Azure using Terraform with basic Terraform commands.
